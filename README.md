## Project Name :- Revenu Generation of the hotel
## Problem Description:- Predict how much revenue the hotel is generating

# Technology Used:-
1-> Pandas
2-> Numpy
3-> Matplotlib
4-> Seaborn
5-> Scikit-learn
# The above steps are done in Analysis.ipynb
# Steps involved in completing the project
Step1:- Reading the dataset using pandas

Step2:- Checking the null values in the datset

Step3:- Replacing the null values with the mean because in the columns where there is null values there are no outliers so replace null value with mean

Step4:- Visualizing the data with the help of the Pie Chart,Bar Chart and Line Chart

Step5:- Then saving the cleaned file into the new file called df_clean.csv

# Now we come to the New Notebook which is Model_training.ipynb

Step1:- Here we import the df_clen.csv using the pandas

Step2:- Now we drop the columns booking_id,property_id

Step3:- Converts the text column into the numbers using the label encoding

Step6:- Now we check the correlation of the independent column with the dependent column and select only that column which are correlated with the dependent column

Step7:- Selection columns are:-
Target Column(Dependent Column):- Revenue_Realized
Independent Column:-
1-> Room Category
2-> Booking Status
3-> Revenue_Generated
4-> No_of_guests

Step8:- Seperating the independent columns and dependent columns

Step9:- Train Test Split is performed on the independent columns and dependent columns

Step10:- Use the diffent machine learning model and finalize the model which is giving the best accuracy and also not overfitting the model

Step 11:- Differnt models which applied on the dataset are:-
1-> LinearRegression
2->  SVR
3-> DecisionTreeRegressor
4-> RandomForestRegressor

Step 12:- We decided the RandomForestRegressor as the final model because it is giving the best accuracy and it is also not overfitting the dataset

Step13:- Finally we have created the pickle file which is useful for deployment purpose

# Deployment of the Machnine Learning model using FastAPI
Step1:- We have created the one App.py file for deploying the Machine Learning model on the FastAPI

# Outcome of the Project:-
Give the independent columns as the input and in output you will get the revenue generated by the hotel
